The viruses are all inside the viruses.psd file. 
But they are all in different layers and the layers are hidden. 

To show virus1, make the v1 layer visible. 
To show virus2, make the v2 layer visible. 
To show virus3, make the v3 layer visible.

If you want to make them in different colours, click on the layer you wish to edit, 
then go to the Tabs. Click Image > Adjustments > Replace colour.
There will be a few sliders. All you need to do is drag the hue slider accordingly.
After you get that virus in a new colour, Save As a different PNG file.
Then undo it on your PSD file, making sure all of the viruses are back to red and you can
use the Replace colour method again.

I already saved them in some colours for easier immediate use.
