textbox(spr_portrait,0,"Ah, Bob, you are awake! There has been a situation- Reports show that Soph-the arrogant, evil SlimeKing of Knowledge has gathered his army of evil slimes beyond the mountains of Seriphos, and is going to launch a full-scale attack on Seriphos to destroy all knowledge and enslave all slimes. Elder Slimey has called for all adventurous slimes to gather at his longhouse. So you should head over there and see. ")
textbox(spr_portrait,0,"Bob! You are finally here! I called for this meeting as there has been a situation and the evil SlimeKing Soph is going to invade Seriphos in a few days' time. The Oracle has spoken to me, and the only way is for an brave, adventurous slime, to venture out, and destroy the evil SlimeKing himself. All of you are gathered here, to see who is able to take up this arduous task of slaying the evil SlimeKing and become the rightful SlimeKing of Knowledge. He has to brave through fire, water, earth, ice and the SlimeKing himself, so if you think you are not able to make it, I will not blame you.")
textbox(spr_portrait,0,"No one?...||| Well, I guess I have to go out there and slay the evil King myself! It's alright, I will not blame any of you...||| What? Bob...you...are you sure you want to take up this arduous journey? I..I would be eternally grateful to you. Wait, before you leave, take this utility belt and this [c_blue]Potion of Invulnerability[c_white], which should aid you in your journey. Before you set off, you should also see Elder Slord to get some training.")
textbox(spr_portrait,0,"Bob! You are right on time. Let's get to training. To move, [c_yellow]use WASD[c_white].|| Your goal is to eat up other evil slimes. [c_yellow]Do note that you can only consume slimes that are smaller than you[c_white], so you need to be careful.|| When you have consumed enough slimes, you will grow and become bigger, so you can eat more slimes! Throughout Seriphos, you can collect [c_yellow]powerups[c_white] to improve your situation, like that Potion Slimey gave you.|| How fun is that!? Try it now.")</code>
